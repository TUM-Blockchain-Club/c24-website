          Europe's biggest student-run blockchain event is back! Hosted again at
          the historic Deutsches Museum in Munich, the{" "}
          <b>TUM Blockchain Conference</b> is bringing together the next
          generation of builders and thinkers in web3 in a non-profit setting
          where technology and substantive discourse take center stage.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our lineup of five tracks - <b>Education</b>, <b>Research</b>,{" "}
          <b>Ecosystem</b>, <b>Applications</b>, and <b>Regulation</b> - with
          experts from industry, academia, and politics, explores the latest
          technologies, projects, and legal landscapes in web3. This year, with
          its own dedicated track, we are placing particular emphasis on
          real-world applications and use cases of web3, exploring why web3
          matters today more than ever. In a world where AI threatens identity
          and information integrity, where ecosystem lock-ins are the norm, and
          true privacy is virtually non-existent in consumer products, web3
          isn't just a trend - it's a lifeline.
          <br />
          <br />
          Munich, home to Germany's largest technical university and a hotbed of
          innovation, sets the stage for this conference. Here, amidst the blend
          of tech and tradition that defines the city, the conference creates a
          platform for connections not just within the web3 community but with
          established companies and government representatives from across
          Germany and Europe. And it's all going down just before Oktoberfest.
          <br />
          <br />
          Behind the scenes, powering this event, is the TUM Blockchain Club - a
          crew of web3 builders with a passion for pushing boundaries. As a
          non-profit organization, we're driven by our love for the tech and our
          commitment to building a better digital world. Together, let's build
          something incredible.
