    description:
      "Ethereum is the most popular platform to create decentralized applications in the form of smart contracts. Due to Ethereum's popularity and fee model, executing transactions can be quite costly, which limits its usability for applications that require many low-value transactions. On the other hand, the Internet Computer, a blockchain-based platform for the execution of general-purpose smart contracts, makes it possible to send transactions quickly and cheaply. Is it possible to combine both platforms? The answer is yes! As we will show in this workshop, you can build smart contracts that run on the Internet Computer but interact with Ethereum to generate powerful cross-chain applications.",
